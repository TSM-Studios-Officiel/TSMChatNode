TSM Chat Node is a decentralized chatting service, allowing **YOU** to take control of your own server, and not having a central server having a look at what's happening inside.  

It allows for multiple customization and configuration options and quick setup options for ease of use, such as :
- Whitelisting system to only allow specific users to join a server
- Storage safeguards for media and text
- Downloadable and on-the-spot launch of any server
- ... and many more!
